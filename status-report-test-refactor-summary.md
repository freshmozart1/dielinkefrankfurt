# Status Report API Tests Refactoring Summary

## What We Changed

### 1. Removed Internal Module Mocks
- **Before**: Mocked `@/lib/group-handlers` and `@/lib/file-upload` entirely
- **After**: Use real implementations, only mock external dependencies (Prisma, Vercel Blob, email)

### 2. Fixed Test Infrastructure
- Added proper transaction support to Prisma mock
- Fixed NextRequest mock to properly handle headers
- Fixed FormData handling for multipart requests

### 3. Updated Test Expectations
- Tests now verify real business logic runs
- File validation uses actual file sizes to trigger real validation
- Email notifications are verified to be attempted
- Database calls match real implementation behavior

## Key Benefits

### For Junior Developers
1. **Tests Document Real Behavior**: You can read the tests to understand how the API actually works
2. **Catch Real Bugs**: Tests will fail if business logic breaks, not just if mocks change
3. **Confidence in Refactoring**: When you change implementation, tests verify behavior stays correct

### What We Test vs What We Don't

**We DO test**:
- ✅ Request validation (status values, required fields)
- ✅ Business logic (file size limits, status transitions)
- ✅ Side effects are attempted (emails, file operations)
- ✅ Error handling for various scenarios

**We DON'T test** (due to necessary mocks):
- ❌ Actual database writes
- ❌ Real file uploads to Vercel Blob
- ❌ Emails actually being sent
- ❌ Real authentication (mocked for simplicity)

## Example: File Upload Test

**Before** (testing mocks):
```javascript
(fileUpload.uploadStatusReportFiles as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValue(['url']);
// Test just verified mock was called
```

**After** (testing real behavior):
```javascript
const largeFile = new MockFile('large.pdf', 10 * 1024 * 1024); // 10MB
// Real validation runs and rejects the file
expect(response.status).toBe(400);
expect(data.error).toContain('exceeds 5MB limit');
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Mock at the boundaries**: Only mock external services, not internal business logic
2. **Test behavior, not implementation**: Verify what the API does, not how it does it
3. **Use real data**: Create test data that triggers real validation and logic
4. **Verify side effects**: Check that emails and file operations are attempted

## Technical Fixes Applied

1. **Headers handling**: Fixed NextRequest mock to properly implement headers.get()
2. **FormData parsing**: Ensured multipart/form-data requests are handled correctly
3. **JSON serialization**: Fixed expectations for how data is stored (e.g., fileUrls as JSON string)
4. **Transaction support**: Added proper Prisma transaction mocking

## Result

All 15 tests now pass while testing real behavior instead of mock behavior. The tests are more valuable, maintainable, and serve as documentation of how the API actually works.
