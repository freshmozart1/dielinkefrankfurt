# Feature Specification: Public Groups Overview Page with Contact Modal

**Feature Branch**: `004-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to create a new public page to present the groups of this project in a different way. My idea is to follow the current styling of my application similar to @src/app/page.tsx with MainLayout and HomePageHeader. In the center of the page I want a accordion per group in this project. Sorted alphabetical. If you open the accordion of a group you can see the group logo if existent and the group description. Additionally I want to add to the group schema that a group can have an optional regular meeting. If a group has a regular meeting, then this should be defined in a free text field. Typical regular meetings are "Jeden 3. Dienstag im Montag" or "Jede zweite Woche Montag" so complex fields. If there is a regular meeting then also the location should be defined. The location definition can be similar to the address fields we are using here @src/components/forms/appointments/fields/AddressSection.tsx Then I also want to add two buttons to the accordion details page. One button is leading to the group details page, where each group has also their status reports @src/app/gruppen/[slug]/page.tsx. The other button should open a modal, where interested people can contact the group responsible persons. The modal should ask for name and email address of the requester and then should provide a text field for the ask to the group. When pressing send this information should be sent to the responsible persons entered for the group. Use an email template similar to the existing ones here @src/emails/notifications"

## Execution Flow (main)

   ‚Üí Constraints: Alphabetical sorting, optional regular meetings
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [Marked in requirements below]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow clear: browse groups, expand accordion, contact/navigate
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements testable via manual interaction
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Group (extended), Contact Request
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec contains some clarification needs
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-09
- Q: Should contact requests be stored in the database for record-keeping, or only sent via email without persistence? ‚Üí A: No database storage for privacy reasons. Contact requests sent via email only: To field contains responsible persons' emails, CC field contains configurable office email address. Office email address configurable via settings dialog in group admin page (stored in GroupSettings singleton model with ID=1).
- Q: What should happen when a group has no responsible persons and a visitor tries to contact them? ‚Üí A: Send email only to office CC address (no To recipients). Note: Responsible persons are expected to be mandatory field, so this edge case should be rare/impossible under normal operation.
- Q: Should the contact modal close automatically after successful submission, or stay open with success message? ‚Üí A: Close automatically immediately after showing brief success message (approximately 2 seconds).
- Q: When a group has a regular meeting defined, should the meeting location be mandatory or optional? ‚Üí A: Optional - regular meeting can exist without location (supports virtual meetings, TBD locations).
- Q: What should happen when email sending fails after a user submits the contact form? ‚Üí A: Show user-friendly error message in modal, log failure for admin review, close modal (no retry option - user must resubmit if needed).
- Q: Where should regular meeting and location fields be editable? ‚Üí A: Must be included in both the public group proposal form (neue-gruppe) AND the admin group edit form to allow adding this information to existing groups.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Stories

**Public Visitor Story**
As a public visitor interested in Die Linke Frankfurt's working groups, I want to browse all available groups in an organized overview so that I can learn about their activities, find their regular meetings, and contact them if I'm interested in participating.

**Group Proposer Story**
As someone proposing a new group, I want to include our regular meeting schedule and location in the proposal form so that interested members know when and where we meet.

**Admin Story**
As an admin managing existing groups, I want to add or edit regular meeting information for groups so that I can keep meeting details up-to-date without creating a new group.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I visit the groups overview page, **When** the page loads, **Then** I see all active groups displayed as collapsible accordions sorted alphabetically by name

2. **Given** I see the groups overview, **When** I click on a group accordion, **Then** it expands to show the group's logo (if available), full description, regular meeting schedule (if defined), and meeting location (if defined)

3. **Given** an accordion is expanded, **When** I view the available actions, **Then** I see two buttons: one to view full group details with status reports, and one to contact the group

4. **Given** I click the "contact group" button, **When** the modal opens, **Then** I see fields for my name, email address, and a message text field for my inquiry

5. **Given** I fill out the contact form with valid information, **When** I click send, **Then** my message is sent to all responsible persons registered for that group and I receive confirmation

6. **Given** I click the "view details" button, **When** the navigation occurs, **Then** I am taken to the existing group detail page showing status reports

7. **Given** I am submitting a new group proposal, **When** I fill out the group proposal form, **Then** I can optionally enter regular meeting schedule and location information

8. **Given** I am an admin editing an existing group, **When** I access the group edit form, **Then** I can add, modify, or remove regular meeting schedule and location information

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a group has no logo? ‚Üí Display placeholder icon
- What happens when a group has no regular meeting defined? ‚Üí Do not show meeting information section
- What happens when a group has a regular meeting but no location? ‚Üí Show meeting schedule without location details (supports virtual/TBD meetings)
- What happens when I submit contact form with invalid email? ‚Üí Show validation error before sending
- What happens when email sending fails? ‚Üí Show user-friendly error message, log failure for admin review, close modal without retry option
- What happens when a group has no responsible persons? ‚Üí Send email only to office CC address (edge case, responsible persons expected to be mandatory)
- What happens when visiting page and no groups exist? ‚Üí Show empty state message
