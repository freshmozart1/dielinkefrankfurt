# Feature Specification: Refactor "Bundesland" Field to Location Details

**Feature Branch**: `002-in-the-appointment`
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "in the appointment form @src/components/forms/appointments/AppointmentForm.tsx I have a field called "Bundesland" or state in this section @src/components/forms/appointments/fields/AddressSection.tsx this is actually a mistake. It should be field for special location information like "B√ºro" or "Saalbau Raum 3" which is a common event location in Frankfurt. I want you to plan the refactor of this field. Its important that this is changed everywhere in the code: Database Schema, Frontend Form, zod Validation and RHF error message. Documentation in the section help field and everywhere you can find information about it. Also in the frontend I want the text field to have the label "Zusatzinformationen"."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature identified: Refactor "Bundesland" field to location details field
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Users submitting appointments, administrators
   ‚Üí Actions: Enter additional location details (room, building name)
   ‚Üí Data: Location detail text field (replaces "Bundesland")
   ‚Üí Constraints: Field must be renamed everywhere (DB, validation, UI, help text)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [‚úì] No clarifications needed - requirements are clear
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí [‚úì] Clear user flow: Enter location details during appointment submission
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí [‚úì] All requirements are testable through manual verification
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí [‚úì] Appointment entity with location detail field
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí [‚úì] No implementation details included
   ‚Üí [‚úì] Focus on user-facing behavior and data meaning
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-07
- Q: What should happen to existing appointment records that have data in the current "Bundesland" field when you refactor it to "Zusatzinformationen"? ‚Üí A: Clear all existing values (start fresh with empty field)
- Q: What specific guidance should the help text provide to users about the "Zusatzinformationen" field? ‚Üí A: Purpose + examples: "Geben Sie zus√§tzliche Ortsangaben an, z.B. Raumnummer oder Geb√§udename"
- Q: What should the database column name be for the refactored field? ‚Üí A: locationDetails (English, descriptive)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users submitting appointment requests need to provide specific location details beyond the basic street address, such as room numbers ("Raum 3"), building names ("Saalbau"), or office identifiers ("B√ºro"). The current field labeled "Bundesland" (Federal State) is misleading and doesn't match the actual use case. Users need a field specifically designed for this additional location information.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is filling out the appointment form, **When** they reach the address section, **Then** they see a field labeled "Zusatzinformationen" (Additional Information) where "Bundesland" previously appeared

2. **Given** a user enters "Saalbau Raum 3" in the additional information field, **When** they submit the form, **Then** this information is saved and displayed correctly in the admin dashboard

3. **Given** an administrator views an appointment, **When** they look at the location details, **Then** the additional location information (e.g., "B√ºro" or "Saalbau Raum 3") is clearly visible and properly labeled

4. **Given** a user leaves the additional information field empty, **When** they submit the appointment, **Then** the submission succeeds (field is optional)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when users enter very long text in the additional information field?
  - System should enforce a reasonable character limit (same as current 100 character limit)
- What happens if no location information is provided at all?
  - Optional field, submission succeeds without it

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST rename the field "Bundesland" to represent additional location information throughout the entire system

- **FR-002**: Users MUST see the field labeled as "Zusatzinformationen" (Additional Information) in the appointment submission form

- **FR-003**: System MUST accept location details such as room numbers, building names, or office identifiers in this field

- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain the optional nature of this field (users can leave it blank)

- **FR-005**: Administrators MUST see the field properly labeled as "Zusatzinformationen" in the admin dashboard

- **FR-006**: System MUST enforce the same character limit (100 characters) as the previous field

- **FR-007**: Validation error messages MUST use the correct German term "Zusatzinformationen" instead of "Bundesland"

- **FR-008**: Help text in the form section MUST display: "Geben Sie zus√§tzliche Ortsangaben an, z.B. Raumnummer oder Geb√§udename" (Provide additional location details, e.g., room number or building name)

- **FR-009**: System MUST clear all existing values in the "Bundesland" field during migration (existing appointment records will have empty "Zusatzinformationen" field after refactor)

### Key Entities
- **Appointment**: Represents event submissions containing location information
  - Basic address fields: street, city, postal code (unchanged)
  - Additional location details field (database column: `locationDetails`): previously labeled as "state/Bundesland", now represents specific location information like room numbers or building names
  - Purpose: The additional information field helps users specify the exact location within a building or venue (e.g., "Raum 3", "B√ºro", "Saalbau")
  - Migration: Existing values in previous field will be cleared (all records start with empty `locationDetails`)
