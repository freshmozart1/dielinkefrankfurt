# Tasks: Refactor Member Portal Navigation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/008-refactor-member-portal/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: This project uses manual testing only (per Constitution Principle II). No automated test tasks are included.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup (Phase 1) completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational (Phase 2) completion
  - User Story 1 (P1): Can start after Phase 2
  - User Story 2 (P1): Can start after Phase 2
  - User Story 3 (P1): Depends on User Story 1 completion (needs BaseNavigation implementation)
  - User Story 4 (P2): Can start after Phase 2
  - User Story 5 (P2): Depends on User Story 4 completion (uses PortalUserInfo component)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (US1)**: Depends on Foundational phase - Creates horizontal navigation
- **User Story 2 (US2)**: Depends on Foundational phase - Creates reusable components
- **User Story 3 (US3)**: Depends on User Story 1 - Validates responsive behavior of navigation
- **User Story 4 (US4)**: Depends on Foundational phase - Creates user info display
- **User Story 5 (US5)**: Depends on User Story 4 - Adds logout to user info component

### Within Each User Story

- Phase 1: Type extraction tasks can run in parallel
- Phase 2: BaseNavigation implementation is sequential (each task builds on previous)
- Phase 3 (US1): Navigation item creation (T015-T016) can run in parallel, implementation is sequential
- Phase 4 (US2): PortalPageHeader creation and page updates can run in parallel
- Phase 5 (US3): All testing tasks can run in parallel
- Phase 6 (US4): PortalUserInfo creation (T057-T063) is sequential, testing tasks can run in parallel
- Phase 7 (US5): Implementation is sequential, testing tasks can run in parallel
- Phase 8: Most polish tasks can run in parallel

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 - All tasks in parallel**:
```bash
Task T001: "Extract MenuItem types"
Task T002: "Update MainLayout imports"
Task T003: "Verify no TypeScript errors"
```

**Phase 4 (US2) - Component creation and page updates**:
```bash
Task T033: "Create PortalPageHeader component"
Task T038: "Update portal page.tsx to use Container"
```

**Phase 5 (US3) - All testing tasks**:
```bash
Task T047-T056: All viewport and responsiveness tests
```

**Phase 8 - Cleanup and validation**:
```bash
Task T086-T093: All code cleanup and validation tasks
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Horizontal Navigation)

```bash
# Create navigation items and imports in parallel:
Task T015: "Create default navigation items array in PortalNavigation.tsx"
Task T016: "Import required Material UI icons in PortalNavigation.tsx"

# After navigation refactoring complete, run all testing tasks in parallel:
Task T029: "Test horizontal navigation on mobile (320px width)"
Task T030: "Test horizontal navigation on desktop (1920px width)"
Task T031: "Test active state highlighting"
Task T032: "Test responsive behavior across breakpoints"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1-3 Only)

**Recommended approach**: Deliver core navigation functionality first

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (Type extraction)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (BaseNavigation component)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Horizontal navigation)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Reusable components)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (Mobile-first validation)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test navigation thoroughly on all devices
7. Deploy/demo MVP - members can now navigate portal with modern horizontal menu

**MVP Delivers**: Fully functional, responsive horizontal navigation matching admin portal design

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation** (Phases 1-2) ‚Üí Types extracted, BaseNavigation ready
2. **MVP** (Phases 3-5) ‚Üí Horizontal navigation, reusable components, responsive design validated
3. **Enhancement 1** (Phase 6) ‚Üí User info display added
4. **Enhancement 2** (Phase 7) ‚Üí Logout functionality added
5. **Polish** (Phase 8) ‚Üí Final validation and cleanup

Each increment adds value without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 2-3 developers available:

**Week 1**: Setup + Foundational (together)
- All developers: Complete Phases 1-2 as a team
- Critical: BaseNavigation must be solid before splitting work

**Week 2**: User Stories (parallel)
- Developer A: User Story 1 (T015-T032) - Horizontal navigation
- Developer B: User Story 2 (T033-T043) - Reusable components
- Developer C: User Story 4 (T057-T071) - User info display

**Week 3**: Integration and Polish
- Developer A: User Story 3 (T044-T056) - Responsive validation
- Developer B: User Story 5 (T072-T085) - Logout functionality
- Developer C: Phase 8 (T086-T100) - Polish and validation

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - safe to run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story (US1-US5) for traceability
- **Independent testing**: Each user story should be independently testable
- **Commit frequently**: Commit after each task or logical group
- **Checkpoints**: Stop at each checkpoint to validate story independently
- **File size limits**: Monitor BaseNavigation.tsx (~250 lines target), keep under 500
- **Type safety**: NO `any` types - check src/types/ before creating new types
- **German text**: ALL user-facing text must be in German
- **Path aliases**: Use @/ for all imports in src/

## Constitutional Compliance Reminders

When implementing tasks, MUST follow the project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`):

**Code Organization** (Principles IX, XI):
- NO file over 500 lines - refactor into modules if needed
- Components in `src/components/portal/` directory
- Types in `src/types/component-types.ts`
- NO database operations needed for this feature

**Type Safety** (Principles I, XII):
- CHECK `src/types/component-types.ts` for existing MenuItem types
- NO `any` types - use strict TypeScript
- Reuse UserRole type from `src/types/user.ts`

**Validation & Logging** (Principles VII, VIII):
- No server-side validation needed (navigation is client-side UI)
- Use `logger` from `@/lib/logger.ts` if logging needed (minimal for UI components)

**User Experience** (Principle VI):
- ALL user-facing text MUST be in German:
  - Navigation labels: "Startseite", "Dashboard", "Einstellungen"
  - Role badges: "Administrator", "Mitglied"
  - Tooltips: "Abmelden", etc.

**Code Quality** (Principles III, IV, V, X):
- Use `@/` imports for all components and types
- Reuse MainLayout submenu patterns (DRY principle)
- Keep BaseNavigation simple and focused (KISS principle)
- Add JSDoc to all component props and functions

**Testing** (Principle II):
- NO automated tests - this project uses manual testing only
- All testing tasks are manual validation steps

Run `npm run check` (lint + typecheck) before committing each phase. NEVER use `npm run build` or `npm run db:push` solely for validation.
