# Feature Specification: Address Management for Appointments

**Feature Branch**: `003-when-creating-a`
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "When creating a new appointment via the public form I can enter an address of an appointment. The ease this process I would like to give users the option to choose from pre existing addresses in a drop down menu. The pre existing addresses should be managed in the admin gui. Here admins can CRUD addresses via a gui element. Therefore I want you to add the SearchFilterBar which is also used here @src/app/admin/status-reports/page.tsx to the appointment GUI here @src/app/admin/appointments/page.tsx Then right to the search element I want to add a button called adresses. When click the GUI element for managing the addresses comes up. I want the edit page to be a full page similar to the newsletter settings @src/app/admin/newsletter/settings/page.tsx in this admin page users can perfrom CRUD actions for addresses. These addresses should then be accessible on the public form. While this implementation I also want you to add the SearchFilterBar and make it work. Analyse the SearchFilterBar whether its a generic component which can be reused. Later I want to reuse it on other locations as well."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature is clear: Address management for appointments
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Public users, Admin users
   ‚Üí Actions: Select address from dropdown (public), CRUD addresses (admin), search appointments (admin)
   ‚Üí Data: Addresses (street, city, postal code, location details)
   ‚Üí Constraints: Reusable components, full-page admin interface
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED: Addresses must have unique name/label field for dropdown display]
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED: Public users can select from dropdown OR manually enter address details (fallback mode)]
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED: Addresses can be deleted without warnings; appointments retain address data copy]
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED: Search filters by appointment title and event details/description with partial matching]
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED: Address edits do not affect existing appointments; only new appointments use updated address data]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow identified for both public and admin scenarios
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements testable and verifiable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Address entity with fields for location data
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All clarification points resolved via /clarify session
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-07
- Q: Should addresses have a display name/label field in addition to the full address components? ‚Üí A: Yes, require a unique name/label field (e.g., "Partei-B√ºro", "Gewerkschaftshaus") for dropdown display
- Q: How should address selection work on the public appointment form? ‚Üí A: Dropdown with manual fallback - users can select a pre-defined address OR manually enter location details
- Q: What should happen when an admin tries to delete an address that is already used in existing appointments? ‚Üí A: Allow deletion without warning - address is removed but existing appointments retain the address data they were created with
- Q: Which appointment fields should the search functionality filter on? ‚Üí A: Search for title and event details (mainText/description content)
- Q: When an admin edits an existing address in the address management interface, what should happen to appointments that previously used that address? ‚Üí A: Preserve existing appointments - appointments retain the original address data they were created with; only new appointments use the edited version

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

**As a public user** submitting a new appointment, I want to quickly select a pre-defined address from a dropdown menu instead of manually entering location details, so that I can save time and ensure consistent address formatting.

**As an admin user**, I want to manage a centralized list of frequently used addresses through a dedicated interface, so that public users have accurate and commonly used locations available for selection.

**As an admin user**, I want to search and filter appointments to quickly find specific entries.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Public User - Address Selection
1. **Given** I am on the public appointment submission form
   **When** I reach the address/location section
   **Then** I see a dropdown menu with pre-defined addresses

2. **Given** I select an address from the dropdown
   **When** I submit the appointment form
   **Then** the selected address is saved with the appointment

3. **Given** no addresses exist in the system
   **When** I view the appointment form
   **Then** I can still manually enter address details (dropdown may show empty state or be hidden, but manual entry remains available)

#### Admin User - Address Management
4. **Given** I am logged into the admin dashboard
   **When** I navigate to the appointments page
   **Then** I see a search bar with an "Adressen" button next to it

5. **Given** I am on the appointments admin page
   **When** I click the "Adressen" button
   **Then** I am taken to a full-page address management interface

6. **Given** I am on the address management page
   **When** I create a new address with location details
   **Then** the address is saved and becomes available in the public form dropdown

7. **Given** I am on the address management page
   **When** I edit an existing address
   **Then** the changes are immediately reflected in the public form dropdown for new appointments, but existing appointments retain the original address data

8. **Given** I am on the address management page
   **When** I delete an address
   **Then** the address is removed from the system immediately without warnings, but existing appointments retain their address data

#### Admin User - Search Functionality
9. **Given** I am on the appointments admin page
   **When** I enter a search term and click "Suchen"
   **Then** the appointment list filters to show only matching results

10. **Given** I have filtered appointments with a search term
    **When** I clear the search
    **Then** all appointments are displayed again

### Edge Cases
- When an address is deleted or edited, existing appointments retain a copy of the original address data (no impact on historical records)
- Only new appointments created after an address edit will use the updated address data
- What happens if an admin tries to create an address with a duplicate name/label (system must prevent with validation error)?
- What happens if a user selects a pre-defined address, then manually modifies the auto-filled fields (manual modifications should be preserved)?
- What happens if no pre-defined addresses exist in the system (users can still manually enter address details)?
- Search uses partial text matching (substring) on appointment title and event details/description fields
- How should search handle special characters, case sensitivity, and German umlauts?

### Key Entities

- **Address**: Represents a pre-defined location that can be selected when creating appointments
  - Contains: Unique name/label (required, e.g., "Partei-B√ºro", "Gewerkschaftshaus"), street address (required), city (required), postal code (required), location details/notes (optional)
  - Uniqueness: Name/label must be unique across all addresses
  - Display: Name/label is shown in dropdown menu for user selection
  - Relationship: Can be referenced by multiple appointments
  - Lifecycle: Created/managed by admins, selected by public users

- **Appointment**: Existing entity that will reference selected addresses
  - Enhanced with: Link to selected Address (if user chooses pre-defined option) OR direct storage of address data
  - Data preservation: When an address is selected from dropdown, appointment stores a copy of the address data at creation time to ensure historical records remain intact even if source address is deleted or edited
  - Immutability: Appointment address data never changes after creation, regardless of changes to the source address in the address library
  - Maintains: Backward compatibility with manually entered addresses

## Notes

### SearchFilterBar Component Analysis
The SearchFilterBar component is already designed as a generic, reusable component:
- Accepts search term state and handlers as props
- Supports additional filters through children prop
- No business logic embedded
- Clean, composable interface
- Ready for reuse across admin pages

### Design Consistency
The address management page should follow the pattern established by the newsletter settings page:
- Full-page layout with container
- Admin navigation at top
- Page header with icon
- Form fields in Paper component
- Save/Cancel buttons at bottom
- Proper spacing and grid layout for form fields
