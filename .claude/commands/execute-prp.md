# Execute TypeScript/Next.js PRP

Implement a TypeScript/Next.js feature using the PRP file.

## PRP File: $ARGUMENTS

## Execution Process

1. **Load PRP**
   - Read the specified PRP file
   - Understand all TypeScript/Next.js context and requirements
   - Follow all instructions in the PRP and extend the research if needed
   - Ensure you have all needed context to implement the PRP fully
   - Do more web searches for Next.js, React, MUI, Prisma patterns as needed
   - Review existing TypeScript interfaces and component patterns

2. **ULTRATHINK**
   - Think hard before you execute the plan. Create a comprehensive plan addressing all requirements.
   - Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps using your todos tools.
   - Use the TodoWrite tool to create and track your implementation plan.
   - Identify React component patterns, Next.js API route patterns, and TypeScript interfaces from existing code to follow.
   - Plan proper error handling for async operations and database transactions.

3. **Execute the plan**
   - Execute the PRP following TypeScript/Next.js patterns
   - Implement all the code with proper TypeScript typing
   - Follow React component patterns and Next.js API route conventions
   - Ensure proper Prisma database operations and error handling
   - Use MUI v7 components with correct Grid system syntax

4. **Validate**
   - Run each validation command (npm run lint, npm run typecheck, npm test)
   - Fix any TypeScript errors, linting issues, or test failures
   - Re-run until all pass
   - Test API endpoints manually if applicable
   - Verify React components render correctly

5. **Complete**
   - Ensure all checklist items done
   - Run final validation suite (npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test)
   - Report completion status with TypeScript/Next.js specifics
   - Read the PRP again to ensure you have implemented everything
   - Verify all TypeScript interfaces are properly defined
   - Confirm all React components follow established patterns

6. **Reference the PRP**
   - You can always reference the PRP again if needed

Note: If validation fails, use TypeScript/Next.js error patterns in PRP to fix and retry. Common issues include:
- TypeScript type errors
- ESLint violations
- Jest test failures
- Next.js API route handler signature issues
- React component prop type mismatches
