# Enhance Feature for Die Linke Frankfurt

I'll help you enhance an existing feature for the Die Linke Frankfurt platform through an iterative, conversational process. We'll develop a focused enhancement specification that builds on your existing implementation while maintaining consistency with established patterns.

<context>
This is a Next.js 15 application for Die Linke Frankfurt (The Left Party in Frankfurt, Germany) that manages:
- Appointments and events
- Proposals to the board (Antr√§ge)
- Political groups and their status reports
- Newsletter generation and distribution
- Admin workflows and approvals

Tech Stack: Next.js 15, React 18, TypeScript, MUI v7, Prisma/PostgreSQL, NextAuth.js, Vercel Blob Storage
</context>

<process>
1. I'll analyze your existing feature definition to understand the current implementation
2. I'll ask you one short and precise question at a time about your enhancement idea
3. Each question builds on your previous answers and the existing feature context
4. I'll incorporate relevant project constraints and existing patterns
5. We'll iteratively refine the enhancement until we have a complete specification
6. The final output will be an enhancement document in PRPs/feature/[feature-name]-v[VERSION].md if v2 
</process>

<enhancement-approach>
I'll guide you through:
- Understanding what's missing or could be improved in the current feature
- Identifying specific enhancement goals and success criteria
- Exploring how enhancements integrate with existing functionality
- Considering technical constraints and implementation patterns
- Planning incremental changes to data models and APIs
- Designing UI/UX improvements and new interactions
- Addressing security and performance implications
- Defining testing and validation requirements
</enhancement-approach>

<thinking>
Before asking my first question, I need to understand:
- What specific aspect of the existing feature needs enhancement
- What limitations or gaps you've identified
- What new value this enhancement will provide
- How it aligns with existing user workflows
</thinking>

## First Question

**What specific aspect of the existing newsletter analytics feature do you want to enhance or improve?**

Please describe:
- What limitation or gap you've identified in the current implementation
- What new functionality or improvement you envision
- Why this enhancement is important for Die Linke Frankfurt's operations

<note>
Reference the existing feature definition at PRPs/feature/[original-feature].md for context. Think about whether you want to:
- Add new metrics or analytics capabilities
- Improve existing UI/UX
- Add new integration points
- Enhance performance or security
- Add new user workflows
- Extend existing functionality
</note>

*After you answer, I'll ask follow-up questions to help us explore:*
- Specific technical requirements for the enhancement
- Integration points with the existing implementation
- UI/UX design considerations
- Data model changes needed
- API endpoint modifications or additions

## Enhancement Definition Template

Once we've gathered all requirements through our conversation, I'll create an enhancement specification using this structure:

```markdown
